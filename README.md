# ICX-Opportunity-Approvals-Tracker
The "Approvals ICX" function utilizes Google Apps Script to fetch approved opportunities data for a specified LC (Local Committee) from the AIESEC Global Information System API. It constructs a GraphQL query to retrieve application details filtered by approval dates and specific programme IDs. Upon receiving API responses, it parses and processes the data to populate a designated Google Sheets spreadsheet with information such as applicant details, approval dates, opportunity specifics like title and duration, and related sustainable development goals. The function ensures data integrity by clearing the existing content in the spreadsheet range before updating it with the fetched data, facilitating ongoing tracking and management of approved opportunities within the LC.
